I have installed odoo from the github platform.
Normal practice.
I also added contributors on git on my repo which I created.

I installed the database user on posgres as a superuser 
$ sudo -s postgres createuser --superuser $(whoami)

I created the  odoo service from teh debian folder

I also created a log file and gave the log file rights with chown

I am getting an error in my logs: import error crop_image does not exist.
Problem wth the web module in my addons.

I created the odoo.conf file copied from the debian foldr.

i uncommented the line for addons_path and changed the port to 8099 because I have a server running on normal port.

But still having the web error problems.  At this point, I am still troubleshooting.

The odoo-bin downloaded with the odoo files has changed and throwing up errors.

I had to use odoo downloaded from nightly.odoo.com in order for this installation to work.

Odoo is now running on port 8009.

The error I was getting was an image_crop error from odoo.tools.  For some strange reason, 
the odoo-bin file which came with the git clone could not properly rea the web folder on my addons.

I used the odoo installed from nightly.odoo.com which installs odoo on /usr/bin/odoo.  This worked.  Wrapping my head to find out why.
